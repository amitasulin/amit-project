            <Accordion.Body>
              If you choose Same-Day or Express Delivery at checkout, you will
              need to be home to receive your order and provide valid
              government-issued photo ID which proves you are 19 years of age or
              older. For Canada Post delivery, if no one is home, the Canada
              Post delivery agent will leave a delivery notice card with
              instructions for pickup. Anyone who is 19 years of age or older
              may accept your order, as long as they show valid
              government-issued photo ID. If your package is being picked up
              from a Canada Post outlet by someone other than you, they must
              show valid government-issued photo ID (or a document such as a
              utility bill) that shows they have the same address as you. If
              they do not live at the same address, they must show valid
              government-issued photo ID and either the notice card (signed by
              you and with their name printed on it) or a letter of
              authorization or a legal document (such as power of attorney)
              demonstrating their authority to act on your behalf.

              What will happen to my Same-Day or Express Delivery order if I use
              a PO box as my shipping address?
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              Same-Day and Express Delivery orders placed with a PO Box shipping
              address will be sent back to the OCS warehouse. Once we receive
              your package and process the return, a refund will be credited via
              the original method of payment.

              confirmation, you should immediately call our customer service

              Will I have to show my ID when I receive my order?

            <Accordion.Body>
              Yes. If you choose Same-Day or Express Delivery at checkout, you
              will need show valid government-issued photo ID which proves you
              are 19 years of age or older to the delivery driver. To accept a
              delivery from a Canada Post delivery agent, you must show original
              valid government-issued photo ID and sign for the package (due to
              ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, they may ask for a verbal signature
              instead). An order can only be delivered to an adult 19 years of
              age or older.
